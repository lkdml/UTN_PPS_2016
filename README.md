# TMH 
![alt tag](https://github.com/lkdml/UTN_PPS_2016/blob/master/documentacion/front-mockups/tmhReadmeLogo.jpg)

## Getting Started

You will need to create the database. 
Start the Database
```
mysql-ctl start
```
Enter in Mysql
```
mysql-ctl cli
```
Now Create the Database
```
create database tmh;
```
Exit
```
exit
```
###ORM Doctrine
You will need to do this with the empty database
```
cd /site/core/libs/vendor/bin
```
Then
```
php doctrine orm:schema-tool:create
```
Then go back to root directory
```
cd -
```
### If you have this database already created
Check if there are new changes and new scripts to run. If not, then start coding!

Otherwise, you will have to drop and start again! Change directory to: /site/core/libs/vendor/bin
```
schema-tool:drop --force
```

## Run Scripts
Enter in Mysql (If you have not started the database, you will need to start it!)
```
mysql-ctl cli
```
Then we select the tmh database
```
use tmh;
```
Then we can run the script (In this example, we are gonna run the script "alta_roles")
```
source documentacion/db-script/alta_roles.sql
```

## Deployment

* Model
* View
* Controller

For model: site/modelo/ . Here are all the entity's that Doctrine will use to match with the database

For views:We work with a framework based on MVC(model-view-controller), so that our views go in site/modulos/back-end/view or site/modulos/front-end/view . For the view we use a .tpl file for the html, the .php will be at site/modulos/back-end/ or site/modulos/front-end and it will have all the smarty information with the call to view.tpl. 

For controller: We use the controller to do all our business logic and also we add the routes that smarty needs. The folders are site/modulos/back-end/controlador/ or site/modulos/front-end/controlador/
